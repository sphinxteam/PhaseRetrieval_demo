# Phase retrieval in high dimensions: Statistical and computational phase transitions

 ## Abstract
We consider the \emph{phase retrieval} problem of reconstructing a n-dimensional real or complex signal <img src="http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%5Cmathbf%7BX%7D%5E%5Cstar&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0" align="center" border="0" alt="\mathbf{X}^\star" width="24" height="17" /> from m (possibly noisy) observations <img src="https://bit.ly/30pUtcW" align="center" border="0" alt="$Y_\mu = | \sum_{i=1}^n \Phi_{\mu i} X^{\star}_i/\sqrt{n}|$" width="174" height="26" />
       , for a large class of correlated real and complex random sensing matrices <img src="http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%5Cmathbf%7B%5CPhi%7D&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0" align="center" border="0" alt="\mathbf{\Phi}" width="17" height="15" />, in a high-dimensional setting where m,n go to infinity while <img src="https://bit.ly/3f6f4qI" align="center" border="0" alt="$\alpha = m/n=\Theta(1)" width="132" height="18" />.

        First, we derive sharp asymptotics for the lowest possible estimation error achievable statistically 
        and we unveil the existence of sharp phase transitions for the weak- and full-recovery thresholds as a function of the singular values of the sensing matrix.. 
        %
        This is achieved by providing a rigorous proof of a result first obtained by the replica method from statistical mechanics.

        In particular, the information-theoretic transition to perfect recovery for full-rank matrices appears at alpha = 1 (real case) and alpha = 2 (complex case).        
        %
        Secondly, we analyze the performance of the best-known polynomial time algorithm for this problem --- approximate message-passing--- establishing the existence of a statistical-to-algorithmic gap depending, again, on the spectral properties of the sensing matrix.
        %
        Our work  provides an extensive classification of the statistical and algorithmic thresholds in high-dimensional phase retrieval for a broad class of random matrices.
